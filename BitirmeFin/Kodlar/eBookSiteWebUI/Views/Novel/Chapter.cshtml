            <p>Under the bright dawn light that shone across the plain, the Bennet Castle, once again, revealed its grandiosity for the whole world to see.</p>
            <p>Compared to other castles owned by knights of the same rank, the Bennet Castle was actually a much more extravagant piece of architecture. It was, in a way, what you’d call a ‘work of an era’. It took about ten years for the First Bennett Lord to finish constructing it. And if it wasn’t for the diligent maintenance of those who came after him, there wouldn’t be such a magnificent landmark standing here to this day.</p>
            <p>Due to the incompetence of its successors over the last few generations, the Bennett family was demoted from one of the most prestige Lords in the kingdom to just a family of knights. This was why the Bennetts were always so ashamed when they talked about their past.</p>
            <p>“What did you find?” Abel pulled the rein on his pony, then drew his new dagger from his waist pocket.</p>
            <p>Usually, a shadow panther wouldn’t appear during the daytime. It liked being in the dark, and it liked ambushing its prey while hiding at the side of the road. An encounter like this was rather unusual, in a way. This panther must’ve been starving to go so far away out of the forest.</p>
            <p>Having dug his dagger inside the shadow panther, Abel quickly let go of his grip and took a few steps back. The panther, on the other hand, started violently jerking its body as it laid on the ground.&nbsp;It didn’t have the energy to keep up the fight, but the bloodlust would just never leave its conscience.</p>
            <p>Abel wanted to make sure that the panther was dead, but Norman pulled him back when he took a step forward. “Be careful,” he said, as he threw the sheath of his sword towards the shadow panther.</p>
            <p>Now that the shadow panther was certainly dead, Norman still wouldn’t let Abel go check on it. Instead, he went ahead to pick up the sheath that he threw.</p>
            <p>“Young Master,” he pointed towards the claw marking on his sheath as he picked it up,&nbsp;“As you can see, most beasts prefer killing their prey instantly.”</p>
            <p>Norman picked up the shadow panther’s corpse on the ground. Then, with a smile on his face, he removed the dagger from its backside and returned it back to Abel.</p>
